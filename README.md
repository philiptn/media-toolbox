# media-toolbox
A collection of various media processing tools/scripts/programs that I use.

### [media-encoder](https://github.com/philiptn/media-toolbox/blob/main/media-encoder/README.md)
Uses ffmpeg and mkvmerge to encode and repack the media. Includes optimized encoding parameters, as well as suggested CRF settings for each codec/tuning. Also supports cropping and resizing.
