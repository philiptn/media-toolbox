# media-toolbox
A collection of various media processing tools/scripts/programs that I use.

### [media-encoder](https://github.com/philiptn/media-toolbox/blob/main/media-encoder/README.md)
A custom media encoder script based on Python. Uses ffmpeg and mkvmerge to encode and repack the media. Includes some custom encoding parameters, as well as suggested CRF settings for each scenario. Will also ask the user for cropping and aspect ratio.
