# media-toolbox
A collection of various media processing tools/scripts/programs that I use.

### [media-encoder](https://github.com/philiptn/media-toolbox/blob/main/media-encoder/README.md)
A custom media encoder written in Python. Video encoding is performed by FFmpeg, with HandBrakeCLI used for auto-cropping and mkvmerge for repacking the media. Supports various video formats, with optimized encoding parameters such as extended b-frames, rc-lookahead and more.

### [bulk-mediainfo](https://github.com/philiptn/media-toolbox/blob/main/bulk-mediainfo/README.md)
Two small utilities that display useful information in MKV files.  

### [dvd-to-episodes](https://github.com/philiptn/media-toolbox/blob/main/dvd-to-episodes/README.md)
A tool that automatically splits and stitches chapters of DVD video files into episodes.
